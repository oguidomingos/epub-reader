Develop a fully functional EPUB audio player application in Python 3.12 on macOS. Utilize EbookLib for EPUB file reading, pyttsx3 or gTTS for text-to-speech functionality in Portuguese, and Tkinter for the GUI. Address the known integration issue with pyobjc and pyttsx3. Ensure the GUI follows a clean, Apple-inspired Material design aesthetic. Include functionalities such as loading EPUB files through the GUI, extracting and displaying text, converting text to audio in Portuguese, and providing audio playback controls (play, pause, stop). Implement robust exception handling and detailed logging for debugging. Test the application with 'O problema dos 3 corpos' from the Downloads folder to ensure all functionalities are 100% operational before completion.
